# QUAD.nibble

QUAD.nibble is a 16-bit, RISC, Harvard architecture CPU. The instruction set has been designed so that the machine code is human-readable, lessening the need for an assembler. Instructions are 16 bits, memory is byte- or word-addressable, and all I/O is memory-mapped.

QUAD.nibble is built in SystemVerilog, with Quartus and Modelsim, and the current hardware target is an Arrow BeMicro Max 10 FPGA development board.
